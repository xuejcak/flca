# flca
Fourier local correlation alignment (FLCA) is an efficient method for aligning images. The idea originates from FLCT, a method for performing local correlation tracking. FLCA can calculation the local corretion of two images pixel by pixel, and the final shift-X and shift-Y are gained as the median values of those from all the pixels. The code has the advantages of being precise, fast, user friendly, and open.
